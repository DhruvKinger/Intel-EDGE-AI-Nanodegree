ls


command to run 
python $MOD_OPT/mo.py --input_model frozen_inference_graph.pb --tensorflow_object_detection_api_pipeline_config pipeline.config --reverse_input_channels 
--tensorflow_use_custom_operations_config /opt/intel/openvino/deployment_tools/model_optimizer/extensions/front/tf/ssd_v2_support.json


in 57.86 seconds I .xml and .bin files



python main.py -m model/frozen_inference_graph.xml -ct 0.6 -c BLUE

from 24 to 42 seconds it didnot worked as it didn't found the bounding boxes around the person and for next person it didn't
detected from 52-53 and also on 1:02 to 1:03 didnt't worked  from 1:05 to 1:06 again 1:35 to 1:36 ,1:52 to 1:53 
so not suitable to choose our model
