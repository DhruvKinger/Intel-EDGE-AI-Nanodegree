1st Model ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco

download the model command
wget http://download.tensorflow.org/models/object_detection/ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco_2018_03_29.tar.gz

unpack the file
tar -xvf   ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco_2018_03_29.tar.gz


to go in the directory
cd ssd_mobilenet_v2_coco_2018_03_29
check the list of files available
ls

export MOD_OPT=/opt/intel/openvino/deployment_tools/model_optimizer
command to run 
python $MOD_OPT/mo.py --input_model frozen_inference_graph.pb --tensorflow_object_detection_api_pipeline_config pipeline.config --reverse_input_channels 
--tensorflow_use_custom_operations_config /opt/intel/openvino/deployment_tools/model_optimizer/extensions/front/tf/ssd_v2_support.json


in 57.86 seconds I .xml and .bin files


command I ran to test
python main.py -m model/frozen_inference_graph.xml -ct 0.6 -c BLUE

Issues obtained here:
from 24 to 42 seconds it didnot worked as it didn't found the bounding boxes around the person and for next person it didn't
detected from 52-53 and also on 1:02 to 1:03 didnt't worked  from 1:05 to 1:06 again 1:35 to 1:36 ,1:52 to 1:53 
so not suitable to choose our model

2nd Model faster_rcnn_inception_v2_coco_2018_01_28

wget http://download.tensorflow.org/models/object_detection/faster_rcnn_inception_v2_coco_2018_01_28.tar.gz

python $MOD_OPT/mo.py --input_model frozen_inference_graph.pb --tensorflow_object_detection_api_pipeline_config pipeline.config --reverse_input_channels 
--tensorflow_use_custom_operations_config /opt/intel/openvino/deployment_tools/model_optimizer/extensions/front/tf/faster_rcnn_support.json
first resulted in genration in 139 seconds
tried both with shape as well as without shape 
--input_shape[1,227,227,3]

142.55 seconds obtained files

files obtained are frozen_inference_graph.xml and frozen_inference_graph.bin and i have renamed 
them to faster_rcnn_model.xml and faster_rcnn_model.bin respectively
both both were giving error core dumped and some more errors

so mentors suggested me to use some other model


ssd_inception_v2_coco_2018_01_28

http://download.tensorflow.org/models/object_detection/ssd_inception_v2_coco_2018_01_28.tar.gz
python $MOD_OPT/mo.py --input_model frozen_inference_graph.pb --tensorflow_object_detection_api_pipeline_config pipeline.config --reverse_input_channels 
--tensorflow_use_custom_operations_config /opt/intel/openvino/deployment_tools/model_optimizer/extensions/front/tf/ssd_v2_support.json

55.66 seconds

files obtained are frozen_inference_graph.xml and frozen_inference_graph.bin and i have renamed 
them to frozen2.xml and frozen2.bin respectively

it also has issues like first model where it failed to detect person in specific specific seconds like :
it failed in respective seconds 0:07,0:17 and when second person came it didn't worked for 17 seconds from 0:25 to 0:42.Similarly for 3rd person it didn't worked in
51st second,53rd and 1:05  again it failed for 20 seconds from 1:35 to 1:50.thus average duration may not be optained exactly so we cann't use this model as well.
